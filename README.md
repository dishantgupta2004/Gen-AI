# Generative-Adversarial-Networks & Generative AI Experiments

This repository contains my learning journey and hands-on implementations based on the **Udemy course by Krish Naik** on **Generative AI, LangChain, and related technologies**.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

This repository is a structured collection of notebooks and scripts that cover:

- Basics and theory of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Practical implementations of GANs in PyTorch
- Exploring LangChain for LLM-based applications
- Vector databases and embeddings
- Use of FAISS and OpenAI embeddings
- Integrating documents and chatbots using LangChain

 Notes
This is a learning project. Code and structure evolve with each lecture.

Special focus is placed on LangChain, Transformers, Prompt Engineering, and Embeddings.
